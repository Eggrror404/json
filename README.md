# **J≈öON**

JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a widely used data format in web applications. However, there has
been ongoing debate about the correct pronunciation of this acronym. In a 
[YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR-f4b0G9lo) featuring the creator of JSON, Douglas Crockford,
he revealed that it should be pronounced as "J≈öON" ("shason" in French accent).

In celebration of this revelation and to ensure that everyone follows the CORRECT pronunciation of J≈öON,
this script comes into action. It alters existing TTF or OTF font files by substituting any occurrence of
"JSON" with "J≈öON", following the one and only CORRECT pronunciation.

## **Prepatched Fonts** ü§ì
We've got some prepatched fonts for every one of you to use.
Go to [/patched-fonts](https://github.com/Eggrror404/json/tree/master/patched-fonts)
and you'll see some fonts modified from Google Fonts.

If something doesn't work - _don't let me know_.
Maybe re-patching it with the script would work :)

## **Prerequisites** üíª
To use this script, make sure you have the following tools installed:
- [FontForge](https://fontforge.org/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## **Usage** üîß
```
usage: substitute.py [-h] [-o OUTPUT] [-n NAME] input_font

positional arguments:
  input_font            The TTF or OTF font to patch

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        The path to save the patched font (default: patched_font.ttf)
  -n NAME, --name NAME  Name of the patched font (default: original font name with `JSON`)

```
Replace `input_font` with the path to your TTF or OFT font file.
Optionally specify the OUTPUT and NAME arguments.

To run the script:
```
$ python substitute.py -o patched_font.ttf -n "J≈öON Font" input.ttf
```
This command will patch the font `input.ttf`, output the patched font as `patched_font.ttf`, and
set its fontname to `J≈öON Font`.

### Pro Tip!

Use the following script to patch all ttf files in a folder, recursively:
```bash
ls ./**/*.ttf | while read font; do
  python substitute.py -o ${font:0:${#font}-4}-JSON.ttf $font
done
```
